            So, I've been working on this project for the past few weeks. Up until yesterday, I spent most of my time reading up on basic theory behind 
            ML/DL compilers. I plan to add much more to this blog to help me reinforce whatever I learn and to log my journey into this field (incase it inspires anyone). 
            
            <br>
            <br>

            I'll get started with some preliminaries: my related background up to this point involves GPU programming (CUDA), systems programming, ML systems, and a bit of compiler construction (LLVM). 
            All of these were picked up through courses at my school, <span class="text-blue-700">U</span><span class="text-orange-500">I</span><span class="text-blue-700">U</span><span class="text-orange-500">C</span>.
            Over the past few weeks, I researched a few more technologies: 
            <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-5 [&>li::marker]:text-xl [&>li::marker]:text-white light-mode:[&>li::marker]:text-[#2d2a28]">
                <li>MLIR</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <br>

            <!-- <span class="font-bold">Why am I doing this?</span> I recently took a course in compilers (CS426 at UIUC) and found it to be super interesting!
            The course was taught by one of the inventors of LLVM which opened up lots of perspective in design philosophy. 
            
            Anyway, I've had the opportunity to interview for a few compiler roles before taking this course.
            
            Thankfully, I knew a little bit about programming GPUs/systems (from CS483 at UIUC, another great course) and didn't do horrible, but there was definitely a knowledge gap. 
            
            <br>
            <br>

            Overtime, I became curious on where the tech stacks I learned about in these interviews come into play in the software world.  -->
